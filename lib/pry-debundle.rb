# To install and use this:
#
# 1. Recommended
#   Add 'pry' to your Gemfile (in the development group)
#   Add 'pry-debundle' to your Gemfile (in the development group)
#
# 2. OK, if colleagues are wary of pry-debundle:
#   Add 'pry' to your Gemfile (in the development group)
#   Copy this file into ~/.pryrc
#
# 3. Meh, if colleagues don't like Pry at all:
#   Copy this file into ~/.pryrc
#   Create a wrapper script that runs `pry -r<your-application>`
#
# 4. Pants, if you don't like Pry:
#   Copy the definition of the debundle! method into your ~/.irbrc
#   Call 'debundle!' from IRB when you need to.
#
class << Pry

  # Break out of the Bundler jail.
  #
  # This can be used to load files in development that are not in your Gemfile (for
  # example if you want to test something with a tool that you have locally).
  #
  # @example
  #   Pry.debundle!
  #   require 'all_the_things'
  #
  # Normally you don't need to cal this directly though, as it is called for you when Pry
  # starts.
